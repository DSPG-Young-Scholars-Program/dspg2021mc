## Data  

#### ACS Data   
For this project we used data form the American Community Survey. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a yearly survey that covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. In this project we used 5-year ACS estimates, this data represents data that has been collected over time. This gives us increased statistical reliability of the data.The 5-year estimates are available for all geographies down to the block group level. We examined both the block and tract levels of this data. 

#### Arlington Park Data 
Additionally, we used data from Arlington County Park Services. This data contained a variety of information from the parks, from park ameneties to general park location to park acerage. This data is public available from https://data.arlingtonva.us/results?term=parks. 


#### EJ Screen Data 
EJSCREEN is an environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators. EJSCREEN users choose a geographic area; the tool then provides demographic and environmental information for that area. All of the EJSCREEN indicators are publicly-available data. EJSCREEN simply provides a way to display this information and includes a method for combining environmental and demographic indicators into EJ indexes.
