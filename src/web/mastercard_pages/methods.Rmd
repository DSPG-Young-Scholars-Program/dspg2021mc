## Methods 

In this project we used a few methods to measure racial equity in Arlington's parks. 

- Literature Review? 
In addition we completed a literature review. Specifically examinng the Nichols piece that examined  accessibility and equity of public park using GIS. 

- Measure of Park Quality
Analyzing amenities and parkscore

- Isochrones 
Created isochrones connecting walking, driving, and public transportation across parks and ammenitites. Mapped from centroid of park and boundary. Merged block and tract ACS with this data to get a sens of acres and block groups together 

- Statisical Tests 
Testing differences between groups for statistical significance. 


- Floating Catchment
This measures demand as values of race in a given geographic area, a lense for examining racial equity.
